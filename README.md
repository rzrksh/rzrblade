# Welcome to rzrblade
Welcome to rzrblade, the one stop tools for developer to do all sort of things. You can freely contribute, modify, fork on the tooling if you want (credit me if you can *wink* *wink*). Here are the current tooling that we have:

## STILL IN WIP

### Running rzrblade

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
